Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben,

I'm a language enthusiast, I enjoy learning new languages and improving my current ones. I live in Tel Aviv and am currently focused on learning Arabic. However, the technological support for learning Arabic for Hebrew speakers is lacking. I'm trying to change that. I believe that technology has the potential to help us overcome barriers and progress our society and knowledge. I am focused on creating didactic tools for language acquisition, focusing on Semitic languages, and exploring the similarities between Arabic and Hebrew, their genetic relations both for language and script. In my research, I'm looking to discover relations and present them using Typographic methods.

I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction and working on Dardashe, a Keyboard that helps Arabic and Hebrew speakers learn the other language. [Join the beta](https://forms.gle/WU5LubUQm1xTBm6o7)! (Currently only supported for iOS) I am also interested in Typography and am currently working on the first Arabrew font, capable of interchangeably moving between Arabic and Hebrew scripts. I'm an aspiring creative coder seeking to bring to the front the commonalities between cultures through language. I'm working as a deep learning engineer and looking for ways to combine Language, Typography, and AI. My research interests lie in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Typography, and Deep Learning.

-  I have developed several visual models for grapheme processing, and I'm looking to analyze more script data and Paleographic evidence (graphemic philology).
-  ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on exploring the relations between Arabic and Hebrew languages and levarage them to facilitate language learning.
-  ðŸŒ± I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Machine Learning & Data Science at Reichman University.
-  I'm learning the Arabic language.
-  ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to NLP, Typography, and language learning tools.
-  ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with implementing state-of-the-art language models and integrating them into language learning applications.
-  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Arabic and Hebrew scripts, language learning techniques, and the intersection of language and technology.
-  I am starting to look into Phonemics.
