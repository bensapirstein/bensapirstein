### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben,

I'm a language enthusiast, creative coder, and aspiring machine learning engineer. I'm passionate about exploring the connections between languages and typography to improve our interaction with our own language. My research interests lie in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Typography, and Deep Learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on exploring connections between graphemics and other aspects of linguistics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing **Masters in Machine Learning & Data Science at Reichman University, Israel** and learning the Arabic language.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to typography, computer graphics, generative art, NLP, and linguistics.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing a smart keyboard for iOS, as well as learning more about HCI concepts.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Arabrew project.
